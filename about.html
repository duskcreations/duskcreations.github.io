  <h2>About Dusk Creations</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to Dusk Creations â€” a portfolio of projects completed in my Southampton based workshop.
    Dusk creations started in 2024 as a creative outlet and way to explore my interest in manufacturing small scientific components to augment my work, as well as other projects for my home and gifts for my friends and family.
    The name Dusk creations is a nod to the persuit of my hobbies and interests after work, late into the evening.

  <h2>About Simon Lane</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a scientist by training, completing an undergraduate in human physiology 
    in Newcastle upon Tyne (2008) and a PhD human reproductive physiology in 
    Newcastle, New South Wales (2012). I was inspired in many ways by my 
    grandfather Clive, who was an alround great guy, but who also follwed 
    a career in science, as a microbiologist. 
    I returned to the UK in 2013 to take a post-doc position at the University 
    of Southampton, where I studied chromosome division in mouse oocytes, 
    and increasingly became interesed in the microscopes, as well as the 
    biology.
